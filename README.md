# RL Dreams: Policy Gradient Optimization for Score Distillation 3D Generation

3D generation has rapidly accelerated in the past decade owing to the progress in the field of generative modeling. Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) based rendering has improved 3D asset generation to a great extent. Further, the recent work of Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization (DDPO) demonstrates that the diffusion process is compatible with policy gradient methods and has been demonstrated to improve the 2D diffusion models using an aesthetic scoring function. We first show that this aesthetic scorer acts as a strong guide for a variety of SDS-based methods and demonstrates its effectiveness in text-to-3D synthesis. Further, we leverage the DDPO approach to improve the quality of the 3D rendering obtained from 2D diffusion models. Our approach called DDPO3D, employs the policy gradient method in tandem with aesthetic scoring. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method that extends policy gradient methods to 3D score-based rendering and shows improvement across SDS-based methods such as DreamGaussian, which are currently driving research in text-to-3D synthesis. Our approach is compatible with score distillation-based methods, which would facilitate the integration of diverse reward functions into the generative process.
